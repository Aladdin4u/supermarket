## Optimizations

One of the first thing I would do improve the architectures and design patterns to increase reusability and maintainability and constant refacturing of the code.

## Lessons Learned:

Utilized callback functions in the useState, and using Redux to handle cart to build a modular and scalable app. I also used firebase a realtime database to store the supermarket product. Through this I learned, how to effectively simplify components to be used different multiple components, .
